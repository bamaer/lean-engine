You can start a simple Node.js server with the scripts here.

Use npm to install the dependencies:

npm install http url d3-node d3  (... and perhaps any other dependency you want to use in your scripts).

Then you can simply run:

node <somescript.js>

This will create a server on localhost with which you can run the LeanWebComponent tests
